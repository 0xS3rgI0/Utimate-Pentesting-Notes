# Windows privilege escalation

### Windows

List users: `net users`

Show current user: `whoami`

Find password strings

```text
findstr /si password *.txt
findstr /si password *.xml
findstr /si password *.ini
dir /s *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*
findstr /spin “password” *.*
findstr /spin “password” *.*
```

Show Windows version: `systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"`

Look for know exploits in current Windows versions

`systeminfo | findstr /B/C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"`

Shatter attacks. \(research and fill in\)

#### Windows 7

Incorrect permission, i.e. programs giving full write privileges to all users. You can then modify files in the directory to execute malicious code.
