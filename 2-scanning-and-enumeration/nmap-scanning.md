# Nmap scanning

### - Network sweep `nmap -sn 10.11.1.1-254`

### - Standard scan `nmap -A 10.11.1.5`

### - Deep scan `nmap -p- -A 10.11.1.5`

```text
-sT = TCP connect scan

-sS = TCP SYN scan

-sU = UDP scan

-sn = disbale port scan, host discovery only, probes with ICMP and several other packets to determine availability

-sN = null scan (no flags sets, can sometimes assist with detecting open ports on firewalled systems)

-sX = Xmas tree scan (FIN, PSH, URG flags on)

-sC = runs default scripts

-sV = attempts to identify the version of the service running on ports

-O = attempts OS detection using TCP/IP fingerprinting

-A = includes -sC, -sV, -O

-p- = scan all ports, not only top 1,000

-Pn = skip host discovery and scan all addresses

-T = enables timing options, from 0 to 5 with 0 being the slowest

-oG = outputs results in a greppable format (-oG filename)

--top-ports=20 = will scan the top 20 ports, number is user specifiable
