# 0 - Pentesting-notes

This is a compilation of notes that I began accumulating while studying to take the OSCP. There are a ton of great resources on the web that I relied on while working my way through the course guide, videos and practicing in the lab.

I organized my notes and material into the various phases of a penetration test, rather than structuring the repository to mirror the OSCP course material. This helped me learn to appraoch a penetration test methodically and I found it useful for learning which tools were applicable during each phase.

Still lots of work to be done...
