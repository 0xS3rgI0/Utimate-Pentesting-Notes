# 80/443 - HTTP\(s\)

HTTP is typically one of the most rewarding exploitation vectors.  Because of the wide range of technologies and implementations, HTTP servers are challenging to secure--which is a great opportunity for pentesters.  When reviewing web servers/applications, here are some areas to focus on.

#### When enumerating, try to answer the following questions:

* What function does the application perform?
* What technologies and software services are present on the server? 
  * Database, OS, Web server
* What language is the application written in?

#### Open a web proxy \(Burp or Zap\) and review the web page in a browser

* Identify links, input fields, login pages, etc.
* Note version or software information--many CMS have known exploits
* Review the page source, look for version info, comments, etc.
* Look at URLs, response headers
* Check for sitemaps/robots.txt

#### Scan the server

```text
nikto -host 10.11.1.5
```

#### Scan for open directories

```

Dirsearch  \(/opt/dirsearch\)
