# Introduction

This is a collection of notes that I started keeping while I was working through the Pentesting with Kali Linux Course.  I've organized the book into chapters aligned with the phases of a pentest.  The first page of each chapter is a simple introduction, with the bulk of the important content nested as separate pages.
