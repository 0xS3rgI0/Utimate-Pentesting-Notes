#### Simple Network Management Protocol \(SNMP\) UDP 161 

SNMP is commonly misunderstood resulting in misconfigurations. We can scan for SNMP using nmap. 

```text
sudo nmap -sU --open -p 161 10.11.1.1-254 
```

We can also use tools such as onesitxyone to attempt to brute force a list of IP addresses 

```text
echo public > community 
echo private >> community 
echo manager >> community 
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do echo 10.11.1.$ip; done > ips onesixtyone -c community -i ips
```
